You are provided with 2 basic screens Dashboard UI. You need to convert the high - fidelity design into code using React/Next and CSS/SASS/SCSS/LESS/Tailwind CSS.

        Use of any other CSS framework is prohibited.

## What you have to achieve -

- The dashboard should be pixel-perfect and look like a replica of the design.
- Donâ€™t blindly copy and paste the Figma inspect code. Use your skills to make it fit all screens.
- The charts should be working with some dummy data.

## Bonus

- Fetch the basic data using Axios/Fetch. (You can build an API or fetch json from public repo)

- Make a basic auth using Google (Login/Signup using google)
